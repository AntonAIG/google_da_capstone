## Google Data Analytics Specialization capstone project
This repository referes to the specialization on **Data Analysis** and is the first in several projects that makes up my data analysis portfolio.

## Case Study
**Bellabeat** Wellness tracker.

### Background:
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The *Analytics department* whould like to understand the performance of their product and customer response to product changes and improvement efforts.

Key business question:

* How can a wellness technology company play it smart?

Using the data analysis processes (`ask`, `prepare`, `process`, `analyze`, and `share`), I was able to:

* Identify the problem that we are trying to solve
* Retrieve the relevant datasets
* Validate and clean the data
* Identify and evaluate trends, relationships, and insights
* Visualize my observations and present to our stakeholders

Our key project deliverables will be in the form of project folders containing SQL queries, processed datasets, dashboard links, presentations, R/Python scripts, charts, and illustrations.
