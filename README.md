### Background:
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The *marketing analytics team* whould like to understand the performance of their product and customer response to product changes and improvement efforts.

Products:

> **Bellabeat app:** This app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, etc.
> 
> **Leaf:** The device can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip.
> 
> **Time:** Uses a timepiece with smart technology to track user activities.
> 
> **Spring:** A water bottle that tracks daily intake using smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day.
> 
> **Bellabeat membership:** This is a subscription-based membership program for its users.

Key business question:

* How can a wellness technology company play it smart?

Using the data analysis processes (`ask`, `prepare`, `process`, `analyze`, `share`, and `act`), I was able to:

* Identify the problem that we are trying to solve
* Retrieve the relevant datasets
* Validate and clean the data
* Identify and evaluate trends, relationships, and insights
* Visualize my observations and present to our stakeholders

Our key project deliverables will be in the form of project folders containing SQL queries, processed datasets, dashboard links, presentations, R/Python scripts, charts, and illustrations.
