## Business task:
We want to discover how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices, and how we can improve a device to fit the useabilities and performance of similar products.
Bellabeat has a series of products identified in the [readme](https://github.com/AntonAIG/google_da_capstone/blob/main/README.md) file.
