# Case study Report
This is a report on the data analysis approach and insights identified.

## Business task:
We want to discover how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices, and how we can improve a device to fit the useabilities and performance of similar products.
Bellabeat has a series of products identified in the [readme](https://github.com/AntonAIG/google_da_capstone/blob/main/README.md) file. We want to analyze smart device usage data and gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices, and apply these insights to improve one of our products.

[Bellabeats](https://bellabeat.com/about/) helps women to unlock their full potential by providing them with tools and services that can track their health performance. Their devices are suitable for every lifestyle.
The key stakeholders shall make decisions based on the insights identified in this analysis.
First, the marketing analytics team will review this report and understand what we have discovered through this analysis. Then I can present it to the senior management (cofounders) - Sando and Srsen. Using our findings and proposals, they can adopt potential improvements that can be included in the product.

#### Product description:
Bellabeat's [Ivy](https://bellabeat.com/ivy/) is a smart device that monitors and records the heart beat rate, sleep cycle, respiratory rate, cardiac coherence, and pyhsical and mental activity of its users. With a corresponding mobile app, you can track your daily activity cycle.

## Preparing the data
Access to the data can be obtained [here](https://github.com/AntonAIG/google_da_capstone/blob/main/datasets/prepare_readme.md)
The metadata can be found [here](https://www.fitabase.com/media/1930/fitabasedatadictionary102320.pdf)
The data contains daily, hourly, and munite-level output of: Activity, Calories, heartrate, Intensities, METs, Sleep, Steps, and weigth log info.
The file format is *csv.* The data was taken from `03.12.2016` - `05.12.2016`. The datasets are in wide and long formats.
The data credible but incomplete. All tables are sorted according to the `customer id` in assending order. For our particular device, the key parameters include: customer id, datetime, heart rate, intensities, steps, sleep, and calories.

## Processing the data
The data was checked for errors in excel.
During data processing, I want clean the dataset from the individual tables and build a master table with all the information combined. The data entries will be in minutes resolutions. In other to achieve this, I have to use SQL to clean the data individually, and then join them.
This table will further be resolved to daily observations and paired with the activity and sleep tables. SQL will be used here too.

The dataset was futher processed in RStudio. Further summary statistics was carried out here to understand the relationships in the features of our dataset.
* We can observe from the summary statistics that most of the 33 participants were lightly active
* The average sleep per participant was 7 hours.
* The average duration spent in sedentary lifestyle is 991 minutes. It's important for Bellabeats to suggest possible ways of reducing this to their customers.
* With an average number of steps at 7638 per day, this number is lower than the recommended number of 10000 by the WHO. At this number, the customers would have to move about more, either by going for a walk or by jogging.

## Analyzing the data

The dataset shows some common information: datetime and participants id, and specific feature related values according to the figure above
First, the individual data was merged according to the figure above. Using this new table, we can subsequently carryon with our visualization.

## Data visualization

With data visualization capabilities in R, we can showcase the best relatioships in the data and tell the story around them. Using the observation, we can further ask some questions that can uncover some other relationships. Three relationships were explored:
* Relationship between total daily calories and the total daily steps taken
![figure1](https://github.com/AntonAIG/google_da_capstone/blob/main/reports/totalsteps_calories.png)
From this figure, we can see that there is a positive correlation between Total steps and Calories. Therefore, the more active we are, the more we burn calories.

* Relationship between the total minutes asleep and the total time in bed
![figure2](https://github.com/AntonAIG/google_da_capstone/blob/main/reports/timeinbed_minutesasleep.png)
This linear relationship shows that more time in bed leads to more sleep.

* Relationship between the total minutes asleep and the total minutes of sedentary living.
![figure3](https://github.com/AntonAIG/google_da_capstone/blob/main/reports/minutesasleep_sedentaryminutes.png)
Here we can clearly see the negative relationship between Sedentary Minutes and Sleep time.

### Conclusion and recommendations
It is very benefitial to understand trends in every business by collecting unbiased data about the particular products that needs improvement, and customer responses to individual products and features. In addition, we need to also understand how our products affects their daily life and showcase how our device can improve certain aspects of their life.
In the case of Bellabeat, our observation shows that:

* If users want to lose weight, itâ€™s probably a good idea to control daily calorie consumption. Bellabeat can suggest some ideas for low-calorie lunch and dinner.
* Most activity happens between 5 pm and 7 pm - I suppose, that people go to a gym or for a walk after finishing work. Bellabeat can use this time to remind and motivate users to go for a run or walk.
* If users want to improve their sleep, Bellabeat should consider using app notifications to go to bed.

Thanks a lot for going through this analysis.
