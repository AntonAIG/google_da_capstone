Bellabeat has a series of products identified in the [readme](https://github.com/AntonAIG/google_da_capstone/blob/main/README.md) file. We want to analyze smart device usage data and gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices, and apply these insights to improve one of our products.
